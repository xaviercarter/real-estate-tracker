# Planning for Real Estate Tracker

## Analyze the apps functionality

As a user....
- I want to be able to add info regarding a potential real estate property deal
- I want to login to view my saved properties
- I want to be able to update an existing saved real estate deal
- I want to be able to delete previously saved real estate deals
- I want to see all saved deals on one view
- I want to click on an individual property and be rerouted to a page for that property where full info will be available to view
- I want a form that will allow me to create a property
    - I want the form field to upload a picture of the property
    - I want to add the address to the property
    - I want to add sale price of property
    - I want to add a reno budget
    - I want to add arv

## Design

- Clean/minimalist
- flat design
- the view page for all properties will have the property listed as "cards" on the page
- font Manrope, Rubik or Nunito Sans

## Wireframe

- High fidelity
    - Working demo (almost)
    - Buttons are clickable
    - Hover effects happen on those buttons
    - More tech demo than a drawing
- Low fidelity
    - Drawing of the app
    - Layout of the page (pages)
    - Where is the header going?
    - Where are my messages to the user going
    - Where are my buttons going
    - Does this feel too crowded? Does this feel to empty

## Pseudocode
1) Render view for login/sign up using oath
2) Create view for index page that the user will interact with
3) Set up server
4) Mount middleware
5) Define routes
6) Create routes module
7) Create controller module
8) Create models module
9) Create additional views
